    "body": "If you're thinking about A.I agents (like clawbot) as very smart assistants, you're missing the bigger picture. As assistant executes on tasks you give it, but an agent - the hint is in the name - has agency (or some simulation of it). Not only does it have a task to complete but it can identify what is the best next step - and then figure out with persistence - how to reach it.\n\nThis leads you to think about how entrepreneurship has always been about the leverage of intelligence. The best leaders attract the highest quality intelligence, and then they are used collaboratively to solve large problems for which the market rewards them handsomely. \n\nBut whereas in the past the intelligence was organic, now it is synthetic. And therefore it is producible (and improved) at a significantly faster rate.\n\nThe ones who win will be those that can orchestrate the largest amount of synthetic intelligence."
